 Today I would like to write a few words about the project I've been working on for quite a while, in particular, a vertical shooter game written in C++. 
 Since I've always been interested in game development, the game was an excellent way for me to understand the structure behind it. To tell you the truth, 
 it was not easy, at all. Lots of things had to be learned along the way, including good coding practices and avoiding common mistakes.

 Arcade Jet 2000 was written using [SFML Game Development Library](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) along with their 2.0 GD Book.
 If you're interested in creating some sort of gaming entertainment, I would highly recommend reading this book. It covers the most important aspects of the game development while guiding you along step by step.

 Being done with the book, you come up with a simple vertical shooter game. I decided to add a little bit of twist to see how well I got the content and, more importantly, in what way I can apply the knowledge I received.
 The result is Arcade Jet 2000 which is quite enjoayble if you're up to some <span style="color:red">challenge</span>. You can download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hmpn57kydui4ryv/Arcade%20Jet%202000%20v1.0.rar?dl=0).
